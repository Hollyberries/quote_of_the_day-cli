# QuoteOfTheDay

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/quote_of_the_day`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/quote-of-the-day` for an interactive prompt.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'quote_of_the_day'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install quote_of_the_day

## Usage

Choose a corresponding number to the displayed quote of the day options.  It will return the chosen quote along with the author.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
